- 👋 Hi, I’m @Daiddx
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Vision and some ML applications in Biomedical Science  & Another project is about EEG processing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Biomedical Science at SJTU (Lab in Tianle Xu and Binlei Zhao -- Two totally different research fields, but I find it fascinating to solve the problem of the brain from different perspectives......)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mice tracking and fine behavioral analysis / about the analysis of EEG using ML (I have trained some svm to distinguish the pattern of EEG but unfortunately failed... and I am going to use RSA to have a try...)
- 📫 How to reach me: ave.emotion.dai@gmail.com
